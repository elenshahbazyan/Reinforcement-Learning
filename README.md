# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository is a collection of projects developed during a Reinforcement Learning (RL) course. It highlights the practical application of essential RL algorithms to solve a wide range of problems, from simple decision-making tasks to more complex environments. Each project is structured to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, with a focus on experimental analysis and results. These projects provide an opportunity to explore RL concepts hands-on and optimize agent performance through rigorous experimentation.
# Projects Overview
# Getting Started
To explore any of the RL projects:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/reinforcement-le arning-projects.git

cd reinforcement-learning-projects

Navigate to a specific project folder: cd project-1

Install dependencies (each project has its own requirem ents.txt): pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the project: python main.py # Or train.py depending on the project

Projects Included

Basic RL Implementations – Foundational concepts applied to simple environments.
Agent Training – Experiments with different reward struc tures and learning policies.
Custom Environments – Simulating unique scenarios for RL models.
Evaluation and Optimization – Analyzing performance and tuning hyperparameters.
Each project's README.md contains details on its approach, cha llenges, and improvements.
