# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Python. The RL agents are trained to play optimally using state-value estimation and can compete against each other or a human player.

## Features
- Train RL Agents: Two RL agents learn optimal strategies through self-play.
- Compete Mode: Trained agents play against each other in a competition.
- Play Against AI: A human player can challenge a trained RL agent.
- State-Based Learning: The game uses all possible board configurations for learning.
- Customizable Training: Set the number of training epochs and competition turns.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- PyCharm (optional, but recommended for development)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Pickle (for saving and loading policies)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elenshahbazyan/Reinforcement-Learning.git
